    # - memory
    #   - No persistence, load in triples on instance start-up (slow start-up time). Graph is required to be kept in
    #     memory during application's lifetime. Not recommended due to slow start-up.
    #   - Difficulty: easy
    #
    # - pickle
    #   - Persistent store by saving a binary (pickle) copy of the Python rdflib.Graph object to disk. Graph is
    #     required to be in memory during application's lifetime. Fast start-up time and fast performance, uses
    #     significantly more memory than Sleepycat. Exact same as the memory method except it persists between
    #     application restarts.
    #   - Difficulty: easy
    #
    # - sleepycat
    #   - Persistent store by storing the triples in the now defunct Sleepycat's Berkeley DB store. Requires external
    #     libraries to be installed on the system before using. Does not require to have the whole triplestore in
    #     memory. Performance is slightly slower than the pickle method (maybe around 10-20%) but uses much less memory.
    #     For each request, only the required triples are loaded into the application's memory.
